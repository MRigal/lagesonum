msgstr "This website was created by volunteers so that people currently not at LaGeSo can check if their number was called upon. There are mobile registration teams coming to the shelters but the process is very slow and unorganized. Sometimes people have to wait 3 days, sometimes 15 days. We hope this service gives a better overview to those waiting.This website was created by volunteers. Its purpose is that people applying for asylum that are currently not at LaGeSo can check if their waiting number was called upon. There are mobile registration teams coming to the shelters but the process is very slow and not transparent enough for the people holding the waiting numbers. People have to wait up to 15 days until the teams arrive. This leads to people distrusting the system and also gives everyone the feeling that they are missing something. Unfortunately it has also happened that people from the official shelters were sent back to LaGeSo the next morning, whether they had a waiting number or not."
